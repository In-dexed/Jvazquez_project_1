NO CSS IN YOUR HTML FILE!!! This means no style at all. No spacing, no centering, no color, no italics. Just raw html.
Absolutely no br tags or use of tables for layout. This is also considered style.
Two spaces indented cascade. Each child element should be indented 2 space right of its parent.
Create a bulleted list at the top of each page. The list items will be the file names of all 3 pages. This is your basic navigation. See index.html template.
Include at least three HTML images and one other form of media (audio or video)
Three images of HTML validation, one for each page. W3C HTML validatorLinks to an external site.
Do not use any pre-build code or frameworks. Write it all from scratch.
Directory-based file structure for links and media. Do not use full URLs when linking to your own content. Example: "css/screen.css" vs. https://missanita2.github.io/itmd-361-spring2018/css/screen.cssLinks to an external site.
